# Library

This Django application offers a good starting point for a library management. Among its features:
-  custom user authentication (email and password)
-  the possibility to hold a book for several days and checkout at the library
-  the possibility to implement a waiting list for already hold (or checkout) books
-  a cron method which controls checkout and hold expiring dates (with a deactivation of user accounts, in case of non benign behaviors)
-  a profile section, where each user can manage his holds and waiting lists
-  basic listing of author and books and a search field

The project will be extended in the future.
